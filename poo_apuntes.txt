OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
What is it useful for?
Object-oriented programming has 4 advantages to it:
Encapsulation: The objects' state is private and other objects can't interact with it unless particularly mentioned.
Abstraction: Only the main mechanisms of objects are shown in the code, as larger codes can get difficult to understand
    when there's many objects in them.
Inheritance: Helps when we have many objects with some resemblances. We can create a class and then form other classes
    based on this one, thus reusing its code. However the second class created can also create its own methods.
Polymorphism: When we have our first class and then the other classes that are based on this one, polymorphism allows
    us to adapt the first class' methods to the latter classes characteristics.
